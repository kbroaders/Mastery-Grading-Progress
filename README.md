# Mastery Grading Progress Plots

I mostly use this notebook to generate heatmaps of student progress in my classes using mastery-based grading. Quizzes contain multiple learning goals (LGs), each of which earn M for meets expectations or R for reattempt needed. The notebook expects an XLSX file in the format shown in the `demo_grades.xlsx` file.

The notebook is made and designed to be used in the [Pluto environment](https://plutojl.org) using the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org). An overview of getting set up with these tools can be found on the [MIT Computational Thinking course page](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Fall24/installation/).
